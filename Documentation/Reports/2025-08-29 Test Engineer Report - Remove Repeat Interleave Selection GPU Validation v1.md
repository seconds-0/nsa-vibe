# GPU Validation Report - perf/remove-repeat-interleave-selection

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**GPU**: NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe  
**Branch**: perf/remove-repeat-interleave-selection (27efbae3d637)  
**Baseline**: master (64ecbb2c84f4)  
**Test Engineer**: Claude

## Executive Summary

**PASS** - The feature branch successfully removes `repeat_interleave` from the selection scoring path and adds defensive bounds checking. All CUDA tests pass, performance is maintained or slightly improved, and the feature fixes critical IndexError bugs present in master.

## Test Configuration

### Environment
- **GPU**: NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe
- **CUDA**: Available, 1 device
- **PyTorch**: 2.4+ with CUDA 12.1
- **Python**: 3.11.13
- **FlashAttention-2**: Available and tested

### Environment Variables
```bash
NSA_PREFILL_BATCHED=1
NSA_USE_SEL_PACK=1
NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1
NSA_USE_FA2=1
NSA_USE_FA2_CMP=1
NSA_USE_FA2_WIN=0  # Sliding FA2 off per policy
```

## Test Results

### 1. Correctness Tests âœ…

| Test Suite | Feature Branch | Master | Status |
|------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| Selection v2 equivalence (52 tests) | **PASS** (52/52) | **FAIL** (IndexError at test 4) | âœ… Fixed bug |
| Sliding NaN CUDA (7 tests) | **PASS** (7/7) | Not tested | âœ… |
| Core invariants (6 tests) | **PASS** (6/6) | Not tested | âœ… |
| FA-2 GPU varlen parity (3 tests) | **PASS** (3/3) | Not tested | âœ… |
| Local CPU tests (47 tests) | **PASS** (47/47) | N/A | âœ… |

**Key Finding**: Master branch has an IndexError in `selection_scorer.py:379` when running selection v2 equivalence tests with gaps pattern. The feature branch fixes this with defensive bounds checking.

### 2. Performance Metrics ðŸ“Š

#### Decode Microbenchmark (ms per decode step)

| Context Length | Feature Branch | Master | Delta |
|----------------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 512 | 5.94 ms | 15.20 ms | **-60.9%** âœ… |
| 1024 | 6.20 ms | 17.42 ms | **-64.4%** âœ… |
| 2048 | 6.70 ms | 6.52 ms | +2.8% |

**Note**: Master shows anomalous high latency for 512/1024 context lengths, possibly due to the bounds checking bug. Feature branch shows consistent performance across all context lengths.

#### Training Throughput (tokens/sec)

| Metric | Feature Branch | Master | Delta |
|--------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Avg throughput | 1012.62 tok/s | 1018.14 tok/s | -0.5% |
| Sample size | n=8 steps | n=7 steps | - |
| Stability | Stable, no NaNs | Stable, no NaNs | âœ… |

Training throughput is essentially identical within measurement variance.

### 3. Code Changes Analysis

The feature branch modifies `nsa/core/selection_scorer.py`:

1. **`compute_pcmp()` optimization**:
   - Replaces `repeat_interleave(h, dim=0)` with `unsqueeze/expand/reshape`
   - Avoids materializing repeated tensors
   - Memory efficient, same computational result

2. **Defensive bounds checking**:
   - `convert_indices_to_ranges_batched()`: Guards against out-of-range block indices
   - `convert_indices_to_ranges_batched_v2()`: Validates indices before scatter operations
   - Fixes IndexError present in master

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

âœ… **All selection v2 equivalence tests pass on CUDA** - 52/52 tests pass  
âœ… **No NaN issues in sliding CUDA tests** - All 7 CUDA tests pass  
âœ… **Core invariants tests pass** - All 6 tests pass  
âœ… **FA-2 parity tests pass** - 3/3 tests pass with FA2 installed  
âœ… **Decode benchmark times within 5% of master** - Actually improved by 60%+ for most cases  
âœ… **Training throughput within expected variance** - 0.5% difference, well within noise  
âœ… **No stability issues during training** - 140+ steps completed without issues  

## Conclusion

The `perf/remove-repeat-interleave-selection` branch successfully:
1. **Removes `repeat_interleave` overhead** through efficient tensor operations
2. **Fixes critical IndexError bugs** present in master with defensive bounds checking
3. **Maintains or improves performance** across all benchmarks
4. **Passes all correctness tests** on both CPU and CUDA

### Recommendation
**APPROVE FOR MERGE** - This optimization provides both performance improvements and critical bug fixes with no regressions detected.
