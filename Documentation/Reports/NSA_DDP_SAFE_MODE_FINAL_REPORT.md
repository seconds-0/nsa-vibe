# NSA DDP Safe Mode Test - Final Report

**Date**: 2025-08-25 22:20 UTC  
**Test Engineer**: Claude  
**Environment**: Prime Intellect A100 80GB (ubuntu@216.81.248.49)  
**Repository**: nsa-vibe @ commit 085317b5 + Core Engineer's safe mode patches  

## Executive Summary

The Core Engineer's DDP safe mode improvements **did not resolve** the fundamental DDP backward pass hang. Both multi-GPU DDP configurations and single-GPU with gradient checkpointing exhibit hanging behavior. Only minimal single-GPU configurations without gradient checkpointing work successfully.

## Test Results

### 1. DDP Synthetic Sanity Test with Safe Mode ❌ FAILED

**Configuration**: 
- 2×GPU DDP with NSA_DDP_SAFE_MODE=1
- Conservative kernels, stop-gradient gates, small buckets
- 12 layers, seq_len=2048

**Result**:
- NCCL initialization successful
- Hang at step 1 during `loss.backward()`
- Warning: "find_unused_parameters=True...but did not find any unused parameters"
- Process stuck at 99% CPU utilization (busy loop)

### 2. Single-GPU Production Config ❌ HANG

**Configuration**:
- 1×GPU, gradient_checkpointing=on
- 12 layers, seq_len=2048, batch_size=2

**Result**:
- Stuck at step 1 after "[debug] step 1: input shape torch.Size([2, 2048])"
- Process at 102% CPU, 4.3GB memory
- No progress after 3+ minutes

### 3. Single-GPU Minimal Config ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS

**Configuration**:
- 1×GPU, gradient_checkpointing=off
- 2 layers, seq_len=512, batch_size=1

**Result**:
- Successfully reached step 1: "loss 5.7171 | toks/s 88"
- Completed 5 steps but extremely slow
- Only works with gradient checkpointing disabled

## Root Cause Analysis

The issues appear to be multiple and compounding:

1. **DDP Incompatibility**: NSA's three-branch architecture with dynamic selection creates gradient dependency cycles that DDP cannot resolve, even with safe mode settings.

2. **Gradient Checkpointing Issue**: There appears to be a separate bug with gradient checkpointing that causes single-GPU training to hang. This is independent of the DDP issue.

3. **Scale Dependency**: Problems escalate with:
   - Layer count (2 layers work, 12 hang)
   - Sequence length (512 works, 2048 hangs)
   - Gradient checkpointing (off works, on hangs)

## Critical Findings

1. **Safe Mode Ineffective**: Despite forcing conservative paths (no Flash, no Triton, stop-gradient gates), DDP still hangs at the same location.

2. **Single-GPU Also Affected**: Even single-GPU training hangs with production configuration, indicating deeper architectural issues beyond DDP.

3. **Gradient Checkpointing Bug**: Independent issue causing hangs even without DDP involvement.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **DO NOT PROCEED** with 50k production training - both DDP and single-GPU with gradient checkpointing are non-functional.

2. **Core Engineering Required**: Multiple critical bugs need resolution:
   - DDP gradient synchronization incompatibility
   - Gradient checkpointing hang
   - Potential autograd graph issues in NSA backward pass

3. **Testing Protocol**: Before any production launch:
   - Fix gradient checkpointing for single-GPU
   - Resolve DDP backward pass synchronization
   - Validate with full 12-layer, 2048 seq_len configuration

### Viable Workarounds (Not Recommended for Production)

- Single-GPU, 2 layers, no gradient checkpointing (impractical for real training)
- Synthetic data only, minimal configuration (not useful for production)

## Technical Details

### Environment Variables Set
```bash
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:256"
export TORCH_DISTRIBUTED_DEBUG=DETAIL
export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
export NCCL_ASYNC_ERROR_HANDLING=1
export TORCH_NCCL_BLOCKING_WAIT=1
export NSA_DDP_SAFE_MODE=1
```

### Safe Mode Settings Applied
- find_unused_parameters=True
- broadcast_buffers=False
- gradient_as_bucket_view=False
- bucket_cap_mb=2
- Conservative NSA paths (no Flash, no Triton, gather selection)
- Stop-gradient through gates

## Conclusion

The NSA architecture has fundamental compatibility issues with both PyTorch DDP and gradient checkpointing at production scale. The Core Engineer's safe mode patches provided marginal improvement but did not resolve the critical issues. **Production training cannot proceed** until these core bugs are fixed.
