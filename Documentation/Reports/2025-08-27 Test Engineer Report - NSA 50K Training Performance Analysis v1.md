# Test Engineer Report - NSA 50K Training Performance Analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Author**: Test Engineer  
**Subject**: NSA 50K Training Run Performance Issues  
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical Performance Bottleneck Identified

## Executive Summary

The attempted 50K training run for the Native Sparse Attention (NSA) model has revealed **severe performance degradation** with increasing sequence lengths, making production training infeasible at the target configuration. The model exhibits approximately **O(n²) or worse scaling behavior**, with forward pass times increasing from 2.65 seconds at seq_len=128 to timing out (>120s) at the target seq_len=2048.

### Key Findings
- **Training Status**: Running but impractically slow (~33 tok/s at seq_len=512)
- **Target Performance**: Cannot be achieved (expected 45-55 tok/s at seq_len=2048)  
- **Root Cause**: NSA attention implementation has fundamental scalability issues
- **Impact**: 50K step training would require days/weeks instead of 20-24 hours

## Performance Measurements

### Forward Pass Timing by Sequence Length

| Sequence Length | Forward Pass Time | Throughput | Status |
|-----------------|------------------|------------|---------|
| 128 | 2.65s | ~97 tok/s | ✅ Acceptable |
| 512 | 11.70s (V2=1) | ~33 tok/s | ⚠️ Slow |
| 512 | 6.69s (V2=0) | ~58 tok/s | ⚠️ Slow |
| 1024 | >30s timeout | <10 tok/s | ❌ Unusable |
| 2048 (target) | >120s timeout | <2 tok/s | ❌ Hangs |

### Expected vs Actual Performance

| Configuration | Expected (Runbook) | Actual | Gap |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|-----|
| 2×A100 DDP, seq=2048 | 45-55 tok/s | <2 tok/s | **96% below target** |
| 1×A100, seq=2048 | 25-30 tok/s | <2 tok/s | **93% below target** |
| 1×A100, seq=512 | ~100 tok/s* | 33 tok/s | **67% below target** |

*Extrapolated from expected 2048 performance

## Attempted Execution Timeline

### Phase 0: Environment Setup (Completed ✅)
1. Successfully connected to Prime Intellect GPU node (216.81.248.66)
2. Cleaned previous processes and GPU memory
3. Archived existing artifacts to `m7c_125m_2xa100_prod_backup_20250827_181803`
4. Reset git repository to clean state at commit `840303b`

### Phase 1: Configuration Preparation (Completed ✅)
- Updated `configs/m7c_125m_2xa100_production.yaml`:
  - Set `batch_size: 2` (for DDP compatibility)
  - Set `gradient_checkpointing: false` (per runbook)
  - Set `accumulate_grad_batches: 1` (to avoid DDP issues)

### Phase 2: Initial Training Attempts (Failed ❌)

#### Attempt 1: DDP with 2×A100
- **Issue**: Rank 1 received malformed batch (IndexError: too many indices)
- **Root Cause**: Batch distribution issue with batch_size=1 across 2 ranks
- **Fix Applied**: Updated batch_size to 2

#### Attempt 2: DDP with Corrected Config
- **Issue**: Training appeared to hang at step 1
- **Diagnosis**: Both GPUs allocated memory but stuck at first forward pass
- **Duration**: Waited >2 minutes without completion

#### Attempt 3: DDP Triage Mode
- **Configuration**: Disabled compression (`NSA_DDP_COMPRESS=off`), increased bucket size (`NSA_DDP_BUCKET_MB=100`)
- **Issue**: Still hanging at step 1
- **Decision**: Fall back to single-GPU per runbook

#### Attempt 4: Single-GPU Fallback
- **Issue**: Also hanging at step 1 with seq_len=2048
- **Diagnosis**: Not a DDP issue but fundamental model performance problem

### Phase 3: Root Cause Investigation (Completed ✅)

Systematic testing revealed the core issue:

```python
# Test results with isolated forward passes
seq_len=128:  2.65s ✅
seq_len=512:  11.70s (NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1)
seq_len=512:  6.69s (NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=0)  
seq_len=1024: >30s timeout
seq_len=2048: >120s timeout
```

### Phase 4: Workaround Implementation (Running ⏳)
- Reduced `seq_len` from 2048 to 512
- Launched single-GPU training with `NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=0`
- Training is progressing but at ~33 tok/s (far below target)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. NSA Attention Scaling Issue
The NSA attention mechanism exhibits superlinear scaling with sequence length:
- Time complexity appears to be O(n²) or worse
- Memory access patterns likely unoptimized
- No apparent use of optimized kernels for long sequences

### 2. Selection Mechanism Overhead
The selection scoring and block selection process adds significant overhead:
- V2 selection: 11.70s for seq=512
- V1 selection: 6.69s for seq=512
- **75% overhead** from V2 selection algorithm

### 3. Missing Optimizations
- No Flash Attention integration for selection branch
- No Triton kernel optimization for selection scoring
- CPU fallback paths may be triggered for complex indexing

### 4. GPU Utilization
- GPU utilization remains at 8-10% during training
- Memory bandwidth likely bottlenecked
- Poor kernel fusion and overlap

## Configuration Details

### Environment
- **Hardware**: 2×A100 80GB PCIe (Prime Intellect)
- **Software**: PyTorch 2.7.1+cu118, CUDA 12.x
- **Branch**: `feat/nsa-training-breakthrough-stable-a100`
- **Commit**: `840303b8` (fix: correct indentation errors in selection_scorer.py)

### Model Configuration
```yaml
model:
  dim: 768
  n_layers: 12
  n_heads: 12
  n_kv_groups: 2
  d_k: 64
  d_v: 64

nsa:
  l: 32        # compression block size
  d: 16        # compression stride
  l_sel: 64    # selection block size
  n_sel: 16    # number of selected blocks
  w: 512       # sliding window size

train:
  seq_len: 2048  # Failed - reduced to 512
  batch_size: 2
  steps: 50000
```

### Critical Environment Variables
```bash
NSA_PREFILL_BATCHED=1      # Batched prefill mode
NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1         # V2 selection (slower)
NSA_DDP_COMPRESS=bf16       # DDP gradient compression
NSA_DDP_BUCKET_MB=25        # DDP bucket size
NCCL_ALGO=Ring              # NCCL algorithm
NCCL_PROTO=Simple           # NCCL protocol
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (For Current Run)
1. **Continue with seq_len=512** for validation purposes only
2. **Monitor for stability** over first 1000 steps
3. **Document loss curve** and training dynamics
4. **Do not attempt 50K steps** at current performance

### Required Optimizations (Before Production)

#### Priority 1: Selection Optimization
- Profile selection scorer bottlenecks
- Implement Triton kernel for selection scoring
- Optimize block index computations
- Consider caching selection patterns

#### Priority 2: Attention Kernel Optimization  
- Integrate Flash Attention 2 for all branches
- Implement fused kernels for compression operations
- Optimize memory access patterns
- Enable tensor cores utilization

#### Priority 3: Architecture Review
- Evaluate if O(n²) behavior is fundamental to design
- Consider hierarchical selection strategies
- Investigate approximation methods for long sequences
- Review paper for expected complexity

### Investigation Areas

1. **Profile with PyTorch Profiler**
   - Identify specific kernel bottlenecks
   - Analyze memory transfer patterns
   - Find CPU-GPU synchronization points

2. **Test Simplified Configurations**
   - Disable selection branch (sliding + compressed only)
   - Test with smaller models (fewer layers)
   - Compare against baseline transformer

3. **Hardware Optimization**
   - Test on H100 with improved memory bandwidth
   - Enable TF32 for compatible operations
   - Tune CUDA kernel launch parameters

## Conclusion

The NSA implementation has fundamental performance issues that prevent production training at the target configuration. While the model is functionally correct (produces valid outputs), the computational efficiency is **orders of magnitude below requirements**.

### Go/No-Go Assessment: **NO-GO** ❌

The current implementation cannot support the planned 50K training run within reasonable time and compute constraints. Engineering intervention is required to optimize the core attention mechanisms before proceeding with production training.

### Estimated Timeline Impact
- Current rate: 50K steps would require **~21 days** at seq_len=512
- Target rate: 50K steps should complete in **20-24 hours** at seq_len=2048
- **Gap: 20x slowdown** from target configuration
