Below is a candid, end‑to‑end performance triage for nsa‑vibe on 2×A100 80GB PCIe (no NVLink), grounded in your brief and what I can glean from the repo’s public surface (README, runbooks, artifacts list) plus production kernel behavior in PyTorch 2.x and FlashAttention. I’ll prioritize what to fix first, why each thing is slow, how to measure it, and exactly what to change. Where I recommend external kernels, I cite what they do on A100 today (not Blackwell/Hopper‑only candy).

TL;DR (what to do first):

Delete Python loops from selection range conversion and keep everything on the GPU. Either consume block indices directly (range‑free path) or implement a GPU run‑length merge. This single change is likely a 2–10× step‑time improvement if your current hotspot is what the brief says.

Guarantee Flash SDPA on cmp/win branches, never falling back to math/mem‑eff unless intended; keep q/k/v contiguous; avoid masks that force fallback.

Reduce DDP sync frequency and bytes: small per‑GPU batch + gradient accumulation + BF16/FP16 DDP comm hook; adjust bucket size for better overlap on PCIe.

Optional but high leverage: switch cmp/win branches to FlashAttention‑2 on A100 and use FlexAttention or xFormers only where you truly need irregular sparsity.

0) What I verified about the repo & your brief

The repo is indeed a “steel‑thread” Native Sparse Attention reference with cmp/sel/win branches, batched prefill, and execution routing over SDPA (FA‑2 optional; Triton selection opt‑in), with tests and CI exposed in the README. 
GitHub

Your consultant brief states training is now stable, ~39 toks/s at seq_len=2048, batch=2 (global), bf16, degraded when increasing per‑GPU batch on PCIe; and points to a Python‑side range conversion in nsa/core/selection_scorer.py::convert_indices_to_ranges_batched as the primary wall‑time hog.

That is a classic pattern: Python loops + .item()/.cpu() + per‑token merges at B×S×G explode at S=2k and serialize the GPU.

1) The likely primary bottleneck (and how to remove it)
1.1 Why the current selection range conversion hurts

In your selection branch you:

score blocks on GPU,

map sparse scores (COO/CSR) to per‑group selections,

merge deduped sorted block indices into contiguous [start, end) ranges per token/head/group, then

feed these ranges into attention.

If step (3) runs in Python over B×S×G, any .item() checks, Python for loops, or host‑side sets/dicts will force host‑device syncs and stall streams. At S=2048, G≥1, k≥(tuned), this can dominate end‑to‑end time even though the actual dot‑products are on GPU. Your brief flags this exactly.

1.2 Two workable fixes (pick one, ship behind a flag)

A. “Range‑free” consumption (highest ROI, simplest)

Don’t form ranges at all. Keep the sorted unique block indices (B,S,G,K) on GPU and consume them directly:

Pack/gather the selected KV blocks for each (b,s,g) into a contiguous ragged buffer using prefix‑sum offsets (GPU cumsum) and index_select/gather.

Feed that packed KV to the selection attention kernel with a small per‑token softmax over the gathered keys only.

This is essentially block‑sparse gather → dense micro‑SDPA on a small context per token. You avoid dedup/merge entirely.

Implementation sketch:

Inputs: idx_sel (int32/int64), guaranteed sorted, -1 padded.

Compute valid = idx_sel != -1; counts = valid.sum(-1).

Offsets per (B,S,G): offs = counts.view(-1).cumsum(0).

Allocate K_packed, V_packed of size offs[-1] × (h_dim) (or block_size * blocks).

index_select/gather K/V blocks into packed tensors; maintain per‑query cu_seqlens style offsets if you want to call a varlen SDPA (FA‑2 provides varlen paths; PyTorch SDPA prefers fixed shapes, see §2).

Run attention over the packed slice for each query (efficient for small K).

Pros: deletes the hotspot; no RLE needed.

Cons: you need a varlen or batched‑ragged attention path. PyTorch SDPA wants standard masks and shapes; FlexAttention can help with custom sparsity (see §3).

B. GPU run‑length merge (“vectorized ranges”)

Keep ranges if downstream code hard‑requires them, but compute them on GPU:

Assume idx is sorted ascending with -1 padding.

Identify run starts where idx[..., j] - idx[..., j-1] != 1 or neighbors are invalid.

Use a cumulative sum over this boolean to get a run id per position.

Then obtain:

starts = idx[is_run_start & valid]

ends = 1 + (segment_reduce over run_id of max(idx))

Use torch.scatter_reduce or torch_scatter to compute per‑run maxima entirely on GPU; avoid .cpu() and Python loops. (Segment/scatter ops are native in PyTorch now; scatter_reduce is available and CUDA‑accelerated.) 
PyTorch Documentation
PyTorch

Notes:

If you must dedup first, prefer torch.unique_consecutive (GPU) over torch.unique (which sorts and can be slower and syncy). 
PyTorch
+1

Keep these tensors contiguous before scatter/gather to avoid extra copies. 
PyTorch Forums

Prefer int32 for indices intra‑pipeline and cast to int64 only at the call site that truly needs it.

Ship behind NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1 for A/B parity vs the old path (you already suggested this in the brief).

Why this can be 2–10×: moving from Python scalar‑driven loops to bulk GPU tensor ops often erases host sync bubbles that dominate wall time at S=2k. The exact uplift depends on how much of your step time is stuck in that loop.

2) Make sure optimized SDPA actually runs (cmp/win branches)

PyTorch’s scaled_dot_product_attention dispatches to one of several backends (flash, mem_efficient, math, cuDNN) based on dtype, device, mask shape, dropout, and tensor layout. On A100 with bf16, Flash should trigger for standard causal or key‑padding masks and contiguous Q/K/V; it will fallback if you pass incompatible masks or non‑contiguous tensors. You should guarantee flash on cmp/win and expect mem_efficient/math on sel if your mask is irregular.

Check/force at runtime (once per process):

import torch
from torch.nn.attention import sdpa_kernel  # new ctx manager (replaces backends.cuda.sdp_kernel)
print("flash enabled?", torch.backends.cuda.flash_sdp_enabled())   # sanity
print("mem_efficient enabled?", torch.backends.cuda.mem_efficient_sdp_enabled())
# Optional: temporarily force only flash to detect fallbacks:
with sdpa_kernel(enable_flash=True, enable_mem_efficient=False, enable_math=False):
    out = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, is_causal=True, dropout_p=0.0)


(Use the new torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel/torch.backends.cuda.* switches to detect/force. Don’t leave “flash‑only” in production; it will error on legitimate corner cases.) 
PyTorch Documentation
+1
GitHub

Masking rules: To stay on Flash, prefer is_causal=True or key‑padding masks. Dense additive masks or arbitrary boolean masks easily trigger a fallback. (PyTorch docs spell out the constraints and the knobs to enable/disable each backend.) 
PyTorch
PyTorch Documentation

Contiguity: Ensure q, k, v, attn_mask are contiguous and in the expected layout before calling SDPA. Non‑contiguous shapes or stray .transpose without a subsequent .contiguous() can degrade dispatch.

If you want even more headroom on A100: use FlashAttention‑2 for cmp/win (supported on A100, BF16/FP16, head dim ≤256). PyTorch SDPA flash is strong, but FA‑2’s kernel family still wins in many training configs.

Do not plan on FA‑3 for A100—Tri Dao’s FA‑3 targets Hopper/Blackwell only.

tridao.me

3) What to use for the selection branch (irregular sparsity)

You have three pragmatic choices on A100:

Stay with SDPA (mem_efficient/math) but fix the host syncs as in §1. This is the least invasive approach and probably enough.

FlexAttention (PyTorch 2.4+) with a block mask: lets you express custom sparsity via a score_mod or BlockMask struct, and torch.compile fuses it into a single kernel. It can skip masked blocks and can be very good if your sparsity is block‑structured. Bench behavior varies with the mask; it’s worth trying because it keeps you in PyTorch and composes well with the rest of your stack. 
PyTorch Documentation
PyTorch

xFormers sparse attention or SageAttention for fast block‑sparse patterns. If your selection is amenable to block patterns, these can outperform generic SDPA on A100. Caveat: integration work and mask support nuances. 
GitHub
+1
facebookresearch.github.io

Given the brief, I’d start with (1). If you want to experiment, prototype FlexAttention over your selected block index list by generating a block mask per batch (with kv indices and per‑row counts) and letting Flex fuse the loop away. 
arXiv

4) DDP on PCIe: cut syncs, shrink bytes, increase overlap

On 2×A100 PCIe you are bandwidth‑bound on all‑reduces. The pattern you observed—throughput drops when per‑GPU batch increases—is textbook.

Keep per‑GPU batch small (1–2); scale with gradient accumulation to reduce the number of global syncs per token.

Tune DDP bucket size. You’re using ~25 MB; try 50–100 MB and measure overlap (Chrome trace).

Register a comm hook to compress gradients during all‑reduce, preferably BF16 on A100 (or FP16) to cut PCIe bytes. This is an officially supported, one‑liner optimization:

from torch.distributed.algorithms.ddp_comm_hooks import default as ddp_hooks
ddp_model.register_comm_hook(None, ddp_hooks.bf16_compress_hook)  # or fp16_compress_hook


(Hooks are part of upstream PyTorch; they reduce bandwidth pressure on PCIe significantly.) 
PyTorch Documentation
GitHub
Lightning AI

Keep NCCL ring on PCIe; “Tree” can help on many‑node latency, but for 2 GPUs ring is fine. (NVIDIA guidance: ring is peak bandwidth; tree is lower latency—best to measure.) 
GitHub
+1
NVIDIA Developer

Overlap sanity check: NVTX ranges show if backprop kernels and NCCL overlap. If they don’t, check that bucket sizes are big enough and streams aren’t being synchronized by stray .item() calls.

5) Smaller but real wins

Fused optimizers: set torch.optim.AdamW(..., fused=True) unless you have a known incompatibility. On A100 bf16 this is generally a win for parameter‑update overhead (measure; there are occasional regressions depending on versions). 
PyTorch Documentation

RMSNorm/LayerNorm fusion: If you have an RMSNorm or LN in the block, prefer fused versions (PyTorch native inductor fuses many patterns; xFormers and Liger also offer fused LN/RoPE kernels). RoPE can also be fused (Liger‑Kernel/FA2 do this) to cut bandwidth. 
arXiv
PyPI

Allocator hygiene: set PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True (and tune max_split_size_mb) to reduce fragmentation if you’re doing many small temporaries in pack/unpack.

Kernel launch overhead: if your training shapes are static after selection refactor, try torch.compile(model, mode="reduce-overhead") to enable CUDA Graphs capturing; on static shapes this can trim Python overhead. (Be careful interacting with DDP; compile after wrapping in DDP and measure.) 
PyTorch
Lightning AI

6) Concrete patch plan (minimally invasive)

Patch 1 — remove Python from range merging (ship as NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2).

Preconditions:

Selection indices already GPU & sorted per (B,S,G), -1 padded.

No .item()/.cpu() anywhere on hot path.

Implementation sketch (GPU RLE):

# idx: (B,S,G,K) int32/int64, sorted asc, -1 padded
valid = idx.ne(-1)
# Replace invalid with a sentinel to avoid false adjacency
x = torch.where(valid, idx, (idx.new_zeros(()) - 2))  # e.g., -2

# True where a new run starts: first element or gap != 1 or invalid
x_shift = torch.cat([x[..., :1], x[..., :-1]], dim=-1)
run_start = valid & ((x - x_shift).ne(1) | ~x_shift.ne(-2))  # start or break

# Assign a run id per element
run_id = run_start.to(torch.int32).cumsum(-1) - 1  # 0-based ids; arbitrary dtype

# Mask out invalids
run_id = torch.where(valid, run_id, run_id.new_full(run_id.shape, -1))

# Gather starts: positions where run_start==True
starts = x[run_start]

# Ends: per run_id, take max(x) + 1
# Build a dense buffer sized to max runs per (B,S,G)
max_runs = run_id.amax(dim=-1, keepdim=True).clamp_min(-1) + 1  # (B,S,G,1)
n_runs_total = max_runs.sum()
# Flatten last dim to scatter-reduce
rid = run_id.view(-1)
xv  = x.view(-1)
out = xv.new_full((int(n_runs_total.item()),), -2)
# scatter-reduce amax over rid >= 0
mask = rid.ge(0)
out.scatter_reduce_(0, rid[mask], xv[mask], reduce="amax", include_self=False)
ends = out.add_(1)
# Now map (starts, ends) back to per-(B,S,G) segments via prefix sums of max_runs


This is schematic; in practice you’ll precompute per‑(B,S,G) run counts, allocate per‑token outputs with enough slack, and maybe store as packed CSR with ptr/idx. No Python loops. (Use torch_scatter if you want simpler segment operations.) 
GitHub
PyPI

Tests:

Equivalence vs old Python path on randomly generated sorted index rows with injected duplicates, boundaries, and padding.

Causality: merged ranges never exceed ≤ t.

NVTX timers around “ranges v2” show sub‑millisecond on S=2048, small K.

Patch 2 — guarantee Flash on cmp/win; audit dispatch once.

At model init: log once which SDPA backend is active per branch (cmp/win/sel).

Ensure: dropout_p=0.0 for attention kernels (during training you may have dropout elsewhere), Q/K/V contiguous, is_causal=True where applicable, masks in the form that Flash supports. Verify with a one‑time call under sdpa_kernel(enable_flash=True, enable_math=False, enable_mem_efficient=False) during a smoke step, catch exceptions, then restore defaults. 
PyTorch Documentation

Patch 3 — DDP: comm hook + bucket tuning.

Register BF16 compress hook on DDP model. Start with 50 MB buckets; then 25 MB; pick whichever gives the best overlap in the Chrome trace. 
PyTorch Documentation

Keep per‑GPU batch at 1; scale with grad accumulation.

Patch 4 — optional: FA‑2 for cmp/win.

If you already have the wiring (your README mentions FA‑2 parity tests optional), flip cmp/win to FA‑2 (A100 supported). Measure end‑to‑end Δ; it often helps especially at S≥2k. 
GitHub

7) Profiling: how to prove each fix works

You already have NSA_NVTX=1 and scripts/profiler_smoke.py. Great. Add two checks:

CPU hotspots: in the Chrome trace, the old convert_indices_to_ranges_batched frame should essentially disappear (no red bars in Python), replaced by a few GPU kernels (scatter/reduce/gather).

SDPA backend confirmation: annotate NVTX around attention calls to label flash vs mem_efficient vs math, and count invocations per step.

Use exactly the smoke you posted in the brief; then A/B with NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1.

8) “Other production kernels we should consider?”

FlashAttention‑2 (A100/Ada/Hopper): still the workhorse for training‑grade attention; supports bf16 on A100; integrates with RoPE fusions; mature. 
GitHub

PyTorch FlexAttention (2.4+): great for custom sparsity when masks align with blocks; leverages torch.compile to fuse into one kernel. Try it for the selection branch if you want to keep masks and avoid bespoke Triton. Results vary with pattern; measure. 
PyTorch Documentation
PyTorch

xFormers: offers memory‑efficient and block‑sparse attention plus fused norms/linears. If your selection pattern can be expressed as block‑sparse, xFormers may be competitive/easier than writing custom CUDA. 
GitHub

SageAttention: an emerging sparse attention API claiming “any block sparse pattern very fast.” Worth a side experiment, but treat as exploratory. 
GitHub

FlashAttention‑3: fantastic, but Hopper/Blackwell only; skip for A100. 
GitHub

9) A few repo‑specific nits to check (quick wins)

Search for sync traps:
grep -R --line-number -E "\.item\(|\.cpu\(|numpy\(|asnumpy\(" nsa/
Any hit in the hot path is suspect. If you need scalars on the host (e.g., logging), batch them and move out of step‑critical regions.

Index dtypes: make intermediate selection indices int32 to halve bandwidth; cast to int64 only at the SDPA call if required.

Contiguity: right before SDPA/FA2 calls, enforce .contiguous() for q/k/v and any masks. This avoids silent fallbacks / extra copies.

Optimizer: AdamW(..., fused=True) if your Torch version supports it well in your environment (2.7+/2.8 docs show it’s first‑class); measure. 
PyTorch Documentation

NVTX granularity: ensure ranges cover: projections+RoPE, pcmp_all, CSR/COO map, top‑k, ranges (old vs v2), per‑branch SDPA forward/backward, gate MLP, optimizer step, and DDP all‑reduce. That attribution will tell you exactly where the step time goes after the big fix.

10) Expectations on A100 PCIe

PCIe is the ceiling for DDP throughput when per‑GPU compute gets faster. Your brief’s observation that larger per‑GPU batch reduces utilization matches ring all‑reduce behavior on PCIe. Use grad accumulation to scale effective batch without increasing syncs.

Post‑vectorization: If the Python merge is indeed the largest chunk, a 2–10× uplift is realistic purely from deleting host syncs and letting the GPU rip. After that, FA‑2 on cmp/win, BF16 comm hooks, and tuned buckets can add another modest but real uplift.

11) “Do this now” checklist (copy/paste into your sprint board)

Implement Range‑Free selection consumption (or GPU RLE) behind NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1.

Unit test: selection equivalence vs old path (Eq.9/Eq.10 semantics).

Remove all for loops and .item() in the selection hot path.

Audit SDPA dispatch on cmp/win.

One‑time run under flash‑only context to assert flash viability; revert to default. 
PyTorch Documentation

DDP tuning for PCIe:

Add BF16 comm hook; test bucket sizes {25, 50, 100} MB. 
PyTorch Documentation

Keep per‑GPU batch small; use grad accumulation to scale.

Optional: enable FA‑2 for cmp/win; measure end‑to‑end delta. 
GitHub

Profiler run (Chrome trace 50 steps) with NVTX on:

Compare pre/post NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2. Attribute % wall time across: selection scoring, sparse map/scatter, ranges, SDPA fwd/bwd, optimizer, DDP.

Where to go next

Once selection is GPU‑vectorized and SDPA routes are clean, we can revisit deeper kernel choices (FlexAttention mask vs pack‑and‑flash micro‑SDPA) and, if budget allows, test on an NVLink box to establish the new cost curve. If you want, I can sketch a micro‑benchmark to isolate selection pack/gather throughput vs attention—that makes it obvious when PCIe, not compute, becomes the limiter.

Short answer: it’s close, but not yet “AI‑agent clear.” The goals and hypotheses are solid; what’s missing is a front‑loaded, do‑this‑then‑that checklist with concrete pass/fail gates, artifacts to save, and branch‑on‑result logic. Below is a preamble you can drop at the top of the brief so an AI coding agent (or a human on low coffee) can execute without ambiguity.

Preamble — Step‑by‑Step Execution Plan (with checks)

Objective: Reproduce the baseline; prove or refute the “Python range merge” hotspot; replace it with a GPU path; ensure SDPA is flashing on cmp/win; reduce PCIe pain with DDP tweaks; relaunch with measurable uplift.

0) Environment snapshot (one‑time)

Purpose: Make runs reproducible.

Commands

python -m torch.utils.collect_env > artifacts/collect_env.txt
nvidia-smi -q -x > artifacts/nvidia_smi.xml
git rev-parse HEAD > artifacts/git_sha.txt


Checks

Artifacts exist; PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121 recorded; GPUs are A100 80GB; PCIe (no NVLink) confirmed.

1) Reproduce baseline + capture traces

Purpose: Lock the baseline step time/tokens/s and a 50‑step Chrome trace.

Commands

# Baseline smoke (synthetic)
NSA_PREFILL_BATCHED=1 NSA_DISABLE_AUX_STATS=1 NSA_NVTX=1 \
CONFIG=configs/m7c_125m_2xa100_production.yaml \
python -u scripts/profiler_smoke.py --dataset synthetic --steps 200

# Manual smoke (real-ish)
NSA_PREFILL_BATCHED=1 NSA_DISABLE_AUX_STATS=1 NSA_TB_DISABLE=1 NSA_DISABLE_CSV_LOGS=1 \
NSA_DDP_STATIC_GRAPH=1 NSA_DDP_FIND_UNUSED=0 NSA_DDP_BUCKET_MB=25 \
NCCL_ALGO=Ring NCCL_PROTO=Simple NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1 \
CONFIG=configs/m7c_125m_2xa100_production.yaml \
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/train_showcase.py --dataset fineweb_edu --steps 300 --precision bf16


Capture

artifacts/profiler/trace_rank0.json (Chrome trace)

artifacts/metrics_baseline.json with: tokens/s, step_time_s, GPU mem, utilization

Pass/Fail

Pass if tokens/s is within ±10% of ~39 toks/s at seq_len=2048, batch_size=2.

Fail: stop and record diffs (driver/toolchain drift, bad env flags, dataset difference).

2) Confirm SDPA kernel routing for each branch (cmp / sel / win)

Purpose: Ensure cmp/win use Flash SDPA; detect any fallback to math/mem‑efficient.

Add once‑per‑process log in nsa/core/nsa_attention.py around each SDPA call:

from torch.nn.attention import sdpa_kernel
def log_sdpa_backend(tag, q, k, v, **kw):
    try:
        with sdpa_kernel(enable_flash=True, enable_mem_efficient=False, enable_math=False):
            _ = torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, **kw)
        backend = "flash"
    except Exception:
        backend = "fallback"
    print(f"[SDPA] {tag} -> {backend}")


Call it with representative tensors during the prefill step (once).

Checks

cmp and win print flash.

If not, fix: ensure is_causal=True or key‑padding masks, zero dropout inside SDPA, and q/k/v .contiguous() before the call.

Pass/Fail

Pass: cmp/win flash.

Fail: log specific branch and the reason; keep going (but note this for post‑vectorization retest).

3) Prove the Python hotspot

Purpose: Attribute wall time to the suspected function.

Action

In nsa/core/selection_scorer.py, bracket:

map_pcmp_to_pslc_batched

convert_indices_to_ranges_batched ⟵ suspect

top‑k selection

any .cpu()/.item() calls
with torch.autograd.profiler.record_function("...") or NVTX ranges if not already.

Checks (from Chrome trace)

convert_indices_to_ranges_batched shows up as a CPU block with significant wall time, often surrounded by GPU idling.

Any .item() shows host sync on the timeline.

Pass/Fail

Pass: It’s clearly hot (e.g., a double‑digit % of step time). Proceed to Step 4.

Fail: If it’s not hot, note actual top offenders (kernel fallbacks, DDP waits, memory copies) and branch to Step 7 early.

4) Implement selection without Python (flag‑gated)

Purpose: Remove Python loops from the selection pipeline.

Two acceptable implementations (pick one and guard with NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1):

Range‑free consumption: keep sorted block indices (B,S,G,K) on GPU and gather selected KV blocks into a packed ragged buffer (prefix‑sum offsets), then run attention over the packed slice per token.

GPU run‑length merge: turn sorted indices into [start, end) ranges via tensor ops only (no .item()), e.g., diff != 1 → run starts → cumsum to run IDs → scatter_reduce (amax) to get ends.

Protectives

No Python for loops over (B,S,G); no .item()/.cpu() in hot path.

Keep indices as int32 internally; cast to int64 only at API boundaries that require it.

Unit tests

New tests comparing old vs new selection outputs on randomized inputs with duplicates, gaps, padding, and boundary cases.

Property: never selects blocks beyond causal position.

Pass/Fail

Pass: Tests green; code path toggled by env; run compiles on A100 bf16.

Fail: Do not remove old path; keep both; log divergence cases.

5) Re‑profile A/B (old vs new selection)

Purpose: Verify the hotspot is gone and throughput improves.

Commands

Re‑run Step 1 with and without NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=1.

Capture

Two Chrome traces, two metric JSONs.

Checks

CPU time for “ranges” stage ≪ before (ideally < 3% of step time).

Overall tokens/s improved meaningfully (exact gain is architecture‑dependent; record the delta).

GPU utilization increases; fewer idle bubbles adjacent to “ranges”.

Pass/Fail

Pass: Clear uplift; proceed.

Borderline: If uplift is small but hotspot is fixed, proceed to Step 6 (DDP).

Fail: If no improvement and SDPA is flashing (Step 2), jump to Step 7 (deeper causes).

6) PCIe‑aware DDP tuning (reduce bytes, reduce syncs)

Purpose: Turn bandwidth knobs that matter on PCIe.

Code change (once in training init)

from torch.distributed.algorithms.ddp_comm_hooks import default as ddp_hooks
ddp_model.register_comm_hook(state=None, hook=ddp_hooks.bf16_compress_hook)  # or fp16


Reruns

Test bucket sizes: NSA_DDP_BUCKET_MB={25,50,100} with the new selection path. Keep per‑GPU batch at 1–2; scale with grad accumulation instead of per‑GPU batch.

Checks

Chrome trace shows NCCL all‑reduces overlapping with backprop compute (not serialized).

End‑to‑end tokens/s improves or stays flat with lower GPU idle.

Pass/Fail

Pass: Choose the best bucket; keep the comm hook.

Fail: Keep the comm hook anyway (reduces bytes) and move on.

7) If still slow — secondary suspects to check

Purpose: Kill other hidden drains.

SDPA fallbacks (again): if cmp/win still not flash, fix mask/layout until they are, or switch those branches to FlashAttention‑2 (A100‑friendly).

Sparse map/scatter hygiene: ensure all scatter/gather paths in map_pcmp_to_pslc_batched run on GPU with contiguous tensors and no dtype upcasts.

Sync traps global grep

grep -R --line-number -E "\.item\(|\.cpu\(|numpy\(|asnumpy\(" nsa/


Remove/relocate hits from the hot path; keep logging in end‑of‑step hooks only.

Fused optimizers: use AdamW(..., fused=True) if supported by your torch build; measure.

Pass/Fail

Pass: Any of the above removes measurable wall time.

Fail: Document and park; proceed to final step.

8) Final deliverables + runbook update

Artifacts to save

Baseline vs post‑fix metrics and traces.

A one‑pager design note: selected approach (range‑free vs GPU RLE), API changes, tests added, and any masking/layout rules required to keep Flash.

Runbook updates

“Known good” env vars and expected tokens/s bands for PCIe vs NVLink.

NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2 flag doc, and the SDPA backend expectations per branch.

Review of your current plan (what’s great vs what to tighten)

Strengths

Clear hypothesis: Python range conversion is hot at S=2048.

You already have NVTX hooks and a profiler harness—excellent observability.

Sensible DDP/NCCL defaults for PCIe (ring/simple; small bucket; static graph).

Concrete optimization targets (2–10×) and controlled rollout (flag‑gated).

Gaps for an AI agent

No explicit pass/fail criteria per step (now added above).

Lacks a branching path if the hotspot is not hot (Step 7 fills this).

SDPA routing is mentioned but not verified programmatically (Step 2 adds a one‑time assert/print).

No unit tests scoped for the selection refactor; equivalence tests are critical (Step 4).

DDP compression hook not explicitly included; it’s an easy PCIe win (Step 6).

Baseline capture lacked a formal artifact list (Step 1 & 8 add that).

Concrete change list the agent can implement (PR‑sized tasks)

 Add NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2 path in nsa/core/selection_scorer.py:

Implement range‑free gather or GPU RLE (no Python loops, no .item()).

Keep indices int32 internally; cast at API boundary if needed.

 Add equivalence tests for selection outputs (new tests/test_selection_equiv.py).

 Add SDPA backend logger (one‑time) in nsa/core/nsa_attention.py as shown above.

 Register DDP BF16 gradient compression hook in the training setup.

 Add CI micro‑bench that times “selection pipeline only” on synthetic B×S×G×K and asserts a regression budget.

 Update runbook with env flags, kernel expectations, and PCIe/NVLink throughput bands.

 Add a grep‑guard CI check that fails if .item()/.cpu() re‑enters nsa/core hot paths.

✅ convert_indices_to_ranges_batched no longer appears as a CPU hotspot; selection pipeline shows GPU kernels only.

✅ cmp/win branches confirmed on Flash SDPA (logged once per process).

✅ DDP comm hook active; chosen bucket size documented.

✅ A/B results show measurable improvement in tokens/s and/or step time, with traces and metrics saved.

✅ Tests cover selection equivalence; flag fallback (NSA_SEL_RANGES_V2=0) remains available.

This preamble turns your plan into a crisp, automatable runbook with clear termination conditions. After this, the interesting frontier is whether FlexAttention or FA‑2 buys further speed on cmp/win, and whether you want to experiment with range‑free micro‑SDPA vs mask‑based sparsity on the selection branch—both are viable, and now you’ll have the tracers to decide.
