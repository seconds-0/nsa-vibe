# M0-M3 FA-2 Benchmark Results - RTX 4090

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (SM 8.9)  
**Environment:** Prime Intellect pod, Ubuntu 22.04, CUDA 12.1, PyTorch 2.4.1+cu121  
**Safety Margin:** 1.2x (minimum speedup to enable FA-2)  

## Executive Summary

**❌ FA-2 FAILS TO MEET PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS ON RTX 4090**

All FA-2 kernels are significantly slower than SDPA on RTX 4090 hardware, with speedups ranging from 0.01x to 0.19x (5-100x SLOWER). These results confirm earlier findings and justify disabling FA-2 for RTX 4090 deployments.

## Benchmark Results

### Sliding Window Performance (w=512)
| S | Speedup | Masked SDPA (ms) | FA-2 (ms) | Status |
|---|---------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| 128 | 0.02x | 1.02 | 66.32 | ❌ 65x slower |
| 256 | 0.04x | 3.60 | 100.62 | ❌ 28x slower |
| 512 | 0.07x | 14.09 | 209.46 | ❌ 15x slower |

**Note:** S=1024,2048 tests terminated due to OOM (8GB allocation on 23.6GB GPU)

### Compressed Attention Performance (l=32, d=16)
| S | Speedup | Masked SDPA (ms) | FA-2 (ms) | Status |
|---|---------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| 128 | 0.19x | 0.55 | 2.86 | ❌ 5x slower |
| 256 | 0.19x | 0.54 | 2.85 | ❌ 5x slower |
| 512 | 0.01x | 0.92 | 147.78 | ❌ 160x slower |
| 1024 | 0.01x | 3.56 | 264.62 | ❌ 74x slower |

## Long-Context Validation

### 64K Needle-in-Haystack Test ✅
```
{'S': 65536, 'pos': 32768, 'cos': 1.0, 'mae': 3.6416167858988047e-08, 'time_ms': 26.4}
```
- **Cosine Similarity:** 1.0 (perfect)
- **MAE:** 3.64e-08 (excellent, well below 1e-3 threshold)
- **Time:** 26.4ms for 64K context
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED - NSA selection attention works perfectly with SDPA

## Updated Configuration

Based on benchmark results, the following conservative thresholds were set in `configs/base.yaml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  fa2_min_len_win: 512   # Conservative (still slower than SDPA)
  fa2_min_len_cmp: 32    # Conservative (still slower than SDPA)  
  sel_triton_min_L: 4096 # Triton disabled on RTX 4090
```

**Reality Check:** Even these "conservative" thresholds enable FA-2 where it's still 5-65x slower than SDPA. For production deployment, recommend setting much higher thresholds (≥4096) to effectively disable FA-2.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **RTX 4090 SDPA Optimization:** PyTorch's SDPA is highly optimized for Ada Lovelace architecture
2. **FA-2 Overhead:** FlashAttention-2 overhead dominates at these tensor sizes
3. **Memory Efficiency vs Speed:** FA-2's memory efficiency doesn't translate to speed on RTX 4090
4. **Consistent Pattern:** Results match M4 Triton findings - SDPA is king on RTX 4090

## Production Recommendations

### For RTX 4090 Deployment:
1. **Disable FA-2 entirely:** Set `fa2_min_len_win: 99999` and `fa2_min_len_cmp: 99999`
2. **Use SDPA everywhere:** Fastest and most stable option
3. **Keep selection path on SDPA:** Long-context capability confirmed (64K needle test)
4. **Monitor GPU memory:** SDPA can OOM at very large sequence lengths

### For Other Hardware:
1. **Re-benchmark on target hardware:** Results are highly GPU-specific
2. **Conservative defaults:** Use SDPA as safe fallback
3. **Profile-guided optimization:** Consider runtime kernel selection
