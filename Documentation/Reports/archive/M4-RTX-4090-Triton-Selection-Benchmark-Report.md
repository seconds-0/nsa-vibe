# M4 Triton Selection Benchmark Report - RTX 4090

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090  
**Test Environment**: Prime Intellect Cloud Pod  
**Engineer**: Claude Code  
**Status**: COMPLETE  

## Executive Summary

This report presents comprehensive benchmark results for Triton selection attention kernels on RTX 4090, following the M4-Triton-Selection-Benchmark-Plan. After extensive testing and investigation of measurement artifacts, **we recommend disabling Triton selection kernels** (`sel_triton_min_L = 2048`) in favor of SDPA fallback for RTX 4090 deployments.

### Key Findings
- **Performance**: Triton is 2-25x slower than SDPA across all tested configurations
- **Accuracy**: MAE exceeds acceptable thresholds (0.15 vs 1e-3) for L‚â•128
- **Stability**: Varlen kernels crash with MLIR compilation errors
- **Recommendation**: Use SDPA fallback with high threshold setting

## Environment Details

```
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090
CUDA: 12.1
PyTorch: 2.5.1+cu121
Triton: 3.1.0
OS: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
Driver: CUDA-compatible
```

## Test Methodology

### Benchmark Approach
- **Reference Implementation**: Direct `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`
- **Timing Method**: 20 iterations with 3-iteration warmup, GPU synchronization
- **Data Types**: float16 for Q,K,V tensors
- **Accuracy Metric**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between Triton and SDPA outputs

### Test Matrix
Following the guide specifications:
- **H** ‚àà {4, 8} (number of heads)
- **D, Dv** ‚àà {64, 128} (key/value dimensions) 
- **N** ‚àà {256, 1024} (batch size)
- **L** ‚àà {64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} (sequence length)
- **Distribution**: Dense single-span patterns (dist="few")

### Critical Investigation: Benchmark Measurement Error

During initial testing, we observed unrealistic speedups (500-1500x) that required investigation. Root cause analysis revealed:

**Problem**: The benchmark script used `grouped_selection_attention_packed` as reference instead of direct SDPA
- Direct SDPA: ~0.02ms ‚ö°
- Wrapped SDPA: ~42ms üêå (2000x slower!)
- This made Triton appear artificially fast

**Solution**: Corrected benchmark to use `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` directly

## Technical Issues Discovered

### 1. Kernel Parameter Conflicts
**Problem**: Autotune decorators conflicted with explicit `num_warps`/`num_stages` parameters
```python
# Caused: TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument 'num_warps'
_sel_attn_fwd_kernel[grid](..., num_warps=4, num_stages=2)
```
**Solution**: Removed explicit parameters, letting autotune handle optimization

### 2. Group Kernel Compilation Issues
**Problem**: Group-centric kernels (`NSA_SEL_TRITON_GROUP=1`) timeout during compilation
**Impact**: Unable to test potentially more efficient group kernels
**Workaround**: Used per-head kernels for all testing

### 3. Numerical Precision Degradation
**Observation**: MAE increases significantly with sequence length
- L=64: MAE ~1e-4 ‚úÖ
- L‚â•128: MAE ~0.1-0.15 ‚ùå (100-1500x worse than threshold)

## Comparison with Guide Expectations

### Expected Deliverables ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Dense CSV results provided
- ‚úÖ Varlen CSV results (all failed, documented)
- ‚úÖ Chosen `sel_triton_min_L` recommendation
- ‚úÖ Error and anomaly documentation

### Performance Expectations ‚ùå
- **Expected**: Find L threshold where Triton ‚â• 1.2x faster than SDPA
- **Actual**: No configurations meet threshold
- **Gap**: Even smallest tested L=64 shows 0.26x speedup (4x slower)

### Accuracy Expectations ‚ùå
- **Expected**: MAE ‚â§ 1e-3 for fp16/bf16
- **Actual**: MAE ‚â§ 1e-3 only for L=64; L‚â•128 shows MAE ~0.1
- **Implication**: Numerical algorithm needs significant improvement

## Production Recommendations

### Immediate Configuration
```yaml
# configs/base.yaml
runtime:
  sel_triton_min_L: 2048  # High threshold forces SDPA fallback
  use_triton_sel: true    # Keep wrapper enabled for future compatibility
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export NSA_USE_TRITON_SEL=1        # Enable wrapper
export NSA_SEL_TRITON_MIN_L=2048   # High threshold
export NSA_SEL_TRITON_GROUP=0      # Disable group kernels
```

### Rationale
1. **Safety**: SDPA fallback is fast, stable, and accurate
2. **Future-proofing**: Wrapper infrastructure ready for kernel improvements
3. **Zero overhead**: Fallback decision adds <1Œºs overhead
4. **Debugging**: Wrapper provides observability for production issues

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Benchmark Validation Critical
- Initial "500x speedup" was measurement artifact
- Always validate reference implementations
- Sanity-check results against literature expectations

### 2. Triton Kernel Development Challenges
- Complex compilation and autotuning interactions
- MLIR type system fragility with advanced patterns
- Performance optimization requires deep GPU architecture knowledge

### 3. Production Safety Principles
- Fallback mechanisms essential for experimental features
- Gradual rollout with high thresholds recommended
- Accuracy validation as important as performance testing

## Future Work Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Fix numerical precision**: Investigate accumulation errors in attention computation
2. **Resolve MLIR crashes**: Address varlen kernel compilation issues
3. **Group kernel debugging**: Resolve compilation timeouts

### Medium Term
1. **Algorithm optimization**: Consider FlashAttention-2 integration
2. **Hardware targeting**: RTX 4090-specific memory access patterns
3. **Autotuning improvement**: Better block size and warp configuration selection

### Long Term
1. **Alternative approaches**: Evaluate vendor libraries (cuBLAS, cuDNN)
2. **Multi-GPU testing**: Validate on A100, H100 architectures
3. **Training integration**: Test backward pass performance and stability

## Conclusion

The comprehensive benchmark evaluation demonstrates that **Triton selection attention kernels are not suitable for production deployment on RTX 4090**. The combination of poor performance (2-25x slower than SDPA), accuracy issues (MAE 100x above acceptable thresholds), and stability problems (varlen crashes) makes SDPA fallback the only viable option.

**Final Recommendation**: Set `sel_triton_min_L = 2048` to ensure all workloads use the fast, stable, and accurate SDPA implementation.
