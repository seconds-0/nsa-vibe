# Core Engineer Test Execution Report

**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Platform**: Prime Intellect 2×A100 80GB PCIe  
**PyTorch**: 2.5.1+cu121  
**Decision**: **NO-GO** ❌

## Executive Summary

The Core Engineer's patches successfully resolved the gradient checkpointing issue. Both reentrant and non-reentrant modes now work correctly. However, testing revealed a new blocking issue: training consistently hangs after ~60 steps, preventing production deployment.

## Test Results

### Phase 1: Single-GPU Testing ✅

| Test | Config | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| GC OFF | Minimal (256 dim, 2 layers) | ✅ PASS | Baseline works |
| GC ON (non-reentrant) | Minimal config | ✅ PASS | Core patch successful |
| GC ON (reentrant) | Minimal + NSA_GC_REENTRANT=1 | ✅ PASS | Reentrant mode works |
| GC Layer Bisection | Not needed | N/A | Both modes work |

**Key Finding**: Core Engineer's patches fixed the GC issue completely. Both checkpoint modes work.

### Phase 2: DDP Testing ✅

| Test | Config | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| DDP One-Step (NCCL) | Minimal, batch_size=2 | ✅ PASS | All 19 params receive gradients |
| Gradient Tracing | NSA_TRACE_GRADS=1 | ✅ PASS | Missing params: 0 |
| DDP with Gloo | Not tested | N/A | NCCL worked |
| Static Graph | Not needed | N/A | Standard DDP works |

**Key Finding**: DDP synchronization works correctly with proper batch size configuration.

### Phase 3: Stability Testing ❌

| Test | Config | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 200-Step Single GPU | Minimal config | ❌ HANG | Hangs at step ~58 |
| 200-Step DDP | Minimal, 2 GPUs | ❌ HANG | Hangs at step ~64 |
| Production Config | 768 dim, 12 layers | ❌ FAIL | Cannot load model |

**Critical Issue**: Training hangs consistently around step 60, regardless of single/multi-GPU.

## Evidence Collected

### 1. Successful GC Fix Confirmation
```
[train] gradient_checkpointing=on
step 0001 | loss 5.7378 | lr 0.00e+00 | toks/s 32
```
- Non-reentrant: 32 toks/s
- Reentrant: 37 toks/s
- Both modes complete successfully

### 2. DDP Gradient Flow Verification
```
[GRAD-TRACE] after_backward_step1 arrived=19 missing=0
step 0001 | loss 5.7135 | lr 0.00e+00 | toks/s 195
```
All parameters receive gradients, no missing parameters.

### 3. Training Hang Evidence
```
step 0064 | loss 5.6942 | lr 1.54e-04 | toks/s 229
[TIMEOUT after 120 seconds]
```
Consistent hang pattern at ~60 steps across all configurations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Fixed Issues ✅
1. **Gradient Checkpointing** - Core Engineer's patches work:
   - Contiguous tensor inputs
   - preserve_rng_state=False
   - Reentrant mode toggle via NSA_GC_REENTRANT

2. **In-place Operations** - Successfully replaced with scatter_add

### Remaining Issues ❌
1. **Step ~60 Hang** - New blocker discovered:
   - Not memory related (only 578MB/80GB used)
   - Not GC related (happens with GC off)
   - Likely data loader or accumulation issue

2. **Production Config** - Cannot load 768-dim, 12-layer model:
   - Even with bf16 precision
   - Possible implementation inefficiency

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Debug Step 60 Hang**:
   ```bash
   # Add detailed logging around step 60
   # Check data loader state
   # Monitor memory fragmentation
   ```

2. **Reduce Model Size**:
   ```yaml
   model:
     dim: 512  # Reduced from 768
     n_layers: 8  # Reduced from 12
   ```

3. **Test PyTorch 2.4.1**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   ```

### Configuration for Next Attempt
```bash
# When step 60 issue is fixed:
export CONFIG=configs/m7c_reduced.yaml  # Smaller model
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="expandable_segments:True,max_split_size_mb:256"
export NSA_GC_REENTRANT=0  # Non-reentrant works fine

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 \
  scripts/train_showcase.py --dataset fineweb_edu --synthetic-on-fail
```

## Conclusion

The Core Engineer successfully fixed the gradient checkpointing issue with the implemented patches. However, a new blocking issue prevents production deployment. The system can complete single training steps but fails during sustained training around step 60.

**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate and fix the step 60 hang
2. Test with reduced model size
3. Consider PyTorch version downgrade if needed
4. Re-run full test suite after fixes

## Artifacts

- Test configs: `configs/test_complete.yaml`, `configs/ddp_test.yaml`
- Logs: `/tmp/test1_clean.log`, `/tmp/ddp_fixed.log`, `/tmp/smoke_200.log`
- Evidence: Gradient traces confirm all parameters updated correctly
