# Smokes & Validation

Goals: fast detection of regressions and training collapse.

What to implement
- 1k‑step smokes: check loss ratio vs baseline; grad health; fetch stalls.
- Gate collapse sentinels (entropy below threshold); label leakage smokes.
- CI integration guidance for CPU + optional GPU runners.

Deliverables
- Smoke scripts/configs and baseline capture — PENDING
